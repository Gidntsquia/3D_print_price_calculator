# :art: Website Buzzer Frontend
This folder contains the frontend for our web app, which is built using HTML/CSS/JS.
Currently, we have a home page with example text on it.

## :file_folder: Project Structure
The project is broken up as follows:

- `*.html`: HTML files for the home page
- `assets/`: Stores all media for the project (e.g., images, fonts, CSS)
- `scripts`: Mostly JavaScript code

## :rocket: Quick Start
Simply open any of the `*.html` files in a web browser to see what they look like :smile:
